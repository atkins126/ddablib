# ddablib: DelphiDabbler Code Library

A library of assorted Delphi components, units and IDE extensions by DelphiDabbler.

> Until 2022/01/16 this library was maintained in a Subversion repository on SourceForge. On that date the contents of that repository's `trunk` converted to Git.
>
> All Subversion commits have been applied to the Git repo's `main` branch. That practise will change with the next release when `main` will begin to contain only the commits that relate to the latest release. All development work will be carried out in the `develop` branch.
>
> The last commit that relates to code imported from the Subversion repo is [f25d049](https://github.com/delphidabbler/ddablib/commit/f25d049465a486bd6f70d73e8b061915e4b56e7c).

## Releases

The whole library has never been released as a single entity - each sub project has received its own releases. That practise may change with the move to GitHub. We'll see! All releases to date can be found on SourceForge in the [DDabLib Files page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddablib/files/).

## Bugs & Feature Requests

For the time being bug reports and feature requests still use the [DDabLib Issue Tracker](https://sourceforge.net/p/ddablib/tickets/) on SourceForge, so please don't open issues on GitHub.
