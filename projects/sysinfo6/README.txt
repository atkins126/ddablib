The sysinfo6 directory is where development of v6 of the System Information Unit
takes place.

This is being done in a separate directory to the normal sysinfo (v5) project
since development of v5.x and v6 must proceed in tandem.

It becomes very messy to have  both v5 and v6 files in the sysinfo directory
because any v6 files must be excluded from v5.x relaeases.
